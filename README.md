# Node_Web_Scraper

This web scraper is designed to scrape certain elements off of event calendars.  
I have designed this scraper to procure event information for the Stanford event calendar website.
You may search any calendar you like by entering the web address for the particular calendar you
wish to scrape. example: http://events.stanford.edu/2018/February/2/

Set Up:
To run this application install node v.7.10.0 on your machine.
In root dir of Node_Web_Scraper:
Run: npm install
     npm start
Node service should be running on port 8090, and web client will be running on localhost:3000
Go to localhost:3000
Use search bar to type desired url of date for Stanford event calendar to scrape i.e.: http://events.stanford.edu/2018/February/2/ and hit submit
Results will render below.
